# Sharp IR - MediaPlayer
Media player handler using SharpIR sensor

## Description
The goal of this project is to interact with media players and allow the user to perform some actions with as less effort as possible, using a Sharp IR distance sensor.

At the moment we are working with two models of this sensor:
- "model name" (5cm to 80cm)
- "model name" (20cm to 150cm)

## Get it running
Connect the sensor to your Arduino board in this manner:

| Wire   | Pin |
|--------|:---:|
| Red    | +5v |
| Black  | GND |
| Yellow | A0  |
